<p><strong>Welcome</strong></p>
<p>For each podcast episode episode your coaches, Mark and Jonah we will give you big overview of the lessons you will learn in your coursework and talk about how to apply the lessons to your assignments.</p>
<p>Assignments take 1 to 2 weeks to complete and we’ll also go over the rubric as well to make sure that you know what we expect from you.</p>
<p>We will also give you specific advice and frameworks to help you complete your projects and help you develop your business ideas.</p>
<p><strong>Program Overview</strong></p>
<p>The value of this not the content, but the support you get from participating in this Nanodegree program.</p>
<p>We are specifically talking about frequent feedback from your reviewers and coaches here at Udacity on your specific idea and gain access to us, your coaches here at Udacity to help mentor and guide you.</p>
<p>We’ve laid out a format for you to strictly follow to learn about business. Follow this format to the letter. Do not deviate from this format because we’re giving you good frameworks in order to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Think about ideas</li>
<li>Communicate your ideas</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the program, you will complete a pitch deck to serve a basis to help build your product.</p>
<p>You are not expected to build the product; there is no coding involved. This Nanodegree program is all about doing the necessary research by etting quick feedback from your customers in the market place.</p>
<p><strong>Brainstorming</strong></p>
<p>Let&#8217;s talk about brainstorming. As part of Project 0.1, you are expected to come up with  three problems and choose one idea to write about. Tell us what idea do you have to solve this problem.</p>
<p><strong>Your Ideas</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>We want to remind you that your ideas are your very own ideas. Udacity does not own your ideas in any way. Our terms of service agreeement outlines that all student work is the property of the student. Here is the link to the <a class="reference external" href="https://www.udacity.com/legal">terms of service</a></p>
<p><strong>Starting off</strong></p>
<p>Put your idea on paper and write it out.</p>
<p><strong>How do you come up with solutions? How do you come up with ideas?</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Observe and listen</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Look at your daily life and see what can you:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Make things faster</li>
<li>Make things easier</li>
<li>Make people feel better</li>
<li>Allow people to do other things in life</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Look at your own problems and needs and wants. Ask yourself what sort of cool stuff can technology help alleviate this problem? What sort of cool stuff can technology help make my life easier?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">What if tech is complicated? What if I don’t know any tech at all?</p>
<p>The Nanodegree program focuses on building applications and building a good UX experience. You know enough technology already because you use software everyday.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">How about building Hardware or advanced software?</p>
<p>This Nanodegree program focuses your efforts on user validation and product design. If you need to know more technology such as AI/ Machine Learning/Stock Trading, you may need to explore another program or read up on the research that’s out there on the internet to get a good enough sense of the how to implement the technology you want to build.</p>
</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Idea generation</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic">
<li><p class="first">Write anything and everything down. Don’t limit yourself
- T-charts
- Mindmaps
- Write 10 ideas in 2 minutes</p>
<p>This is a &#8220;shotgun&#8221; approach. We write freely and think of all the crazy stuff that could happen. We’ll go more into more detail in the next lesson and refine your ideas. the first step is to just write something down so we can give you your first feedback.</p>

<p><strong>Choosing Idea</strong></p>
<p>In this episode, we explore the interviews in the lesson and highlight the big concepts you should take away</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Entrepreneurial Mindset</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first">Seek problem that you’re having yourself - Aaron Harris from Y-Comb</p>

<li><p class="first">Be in a growth market. Rising tide.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><strong>Nir Eyal - Hooked Model</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The Hooked Model:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Trigger:</strong> Graph people&#8217;s attention and guide them to what you want to do</li>
<li><strong>Action:</strong> Make sure what you&#8217;re asking users to do is clear</li>
<li><strong>Reward:</strong> Give people a reward for the action. Make sure reward is variable</li>
<li><strong>Invest:</strong> The actions should get people to invest more time and effort into the app. This will keep them coming back.</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic" start="3">
<li><p class="first"><strong>Execution is key, ideas are cheap</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>As we’ve said many times, the people matter more than the idea. Plus you can’t do a good job on something unless you’re genuinely interested in it. So don’t apply with an idea described in an RFS if there’s some other idea you’d rather work on. You’re more likely to get funded to work on the idea you actually like. - YCombinator website</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>What idea can you execute on?</strong></dt>
<dd><dl class="first last docutils">
<dt>Make sure the idea you&#8217;re working contains these four elements:</dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>Problem is a vitmain or a painkiller</li>
<li>You can make money off this idea</li>
<li>It is focused and can be simply understood</li>
<li>Personally relevant. Try to solve a problem that you personally have.</li>
</ol>

<div class="section" id="episode-3">
<span id="podcast-episode-3"></span><h3>Episode 3<a class="headerlink" href="#episode-3" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Link to <a class="reference external" href="https://soundcloud.com/udacity-tech-entrepreneur/e03-validate-your-idea">Podcast</a></p>
<p>At this stage, you need to validate whether the problem is actually a pain other people face and whether your idea can actually address the pain.</p>
<p>Later on in course, we’ll show you more techniques for market validation, but the best way to get things going is to simply get out there and talk with people and understand their pain points, needs, and desires.</p>
<p><strong>Tomer Sharon</strong> talks about how to do user research</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Write questions you want to answer</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Ask people these questions</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Get answers to help make decisions</p>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>What kind of questions should I ask?</strong></dt>
<dd><ul class="first simple">
<li>What do people need?</li>
<li>What do people want?</li>
<li>Can they use the product?</li>
</ul>
<p>Focus on what people need and want. Try to go out and verify whether the problem you identified is a problem other people face?.</p>
<p>Avoid telling people your solution first! Try to verify the problem and understand what people have done to cope with the problem.</p>
<p class="last">This process will give you insight to competitors and the status quo of dealing with the problem now.</p>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the research, you then ask your questions relating to your solution and figure out whether your solution may help solve the problem these people face.</p>
<p><strong>Aaron Harris</strong> seems to have a contrasting viewpoint</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Build something and just let people interact with it! Get people to try it out!</li>
<li>You have a hunch, you build something for yourself, and then you go and test it out!</li>
<li>Pick people and give it out to them and iterate fast on it.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">With these two viewpoints, what do you do?</p>
<p><strong>Scenario 1</strong>: You have nothing; starting from scratc and cannot build anything fast</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Follow Tomer’s advice: first go out out and verify the problem and write your observations.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Scenario 2</strong>: You’ve verified the problem exists already</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Make your mockups, build something that can be interactive like a powerpoint slide with your drawings or a simple website with your drawings with links for people to navigate your mockups. Build it and show it in front of people.</p>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Don’t forget to make sure you to define what questions you want to answer as well during this process.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Additional Resources</strong></p>
<p>Michael talks a little more detail on UX research and prototyping. He’ll
reiterate what we just talked about in your different stages in your
Research.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first">Prototyping:</p>

<li><p class="first">Drawings</p>

<li>Pixate, Invision, Balsamiq</li>
</ol>
</dd>
</dl>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>I also created a webcast that talked about identifying your critical
questions to help you figure out how to start conducting research. It’s a
framework that takes you from observations to you identifying your critical
questions you should ask in order to get your research started on:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first">The customer</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">The competition</p>

</dl>
<p>Let&#8217;s first go back to Niche and Large Markets? What is that? Why do you hear this thrown around in the Entrepreneur scene?</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Niche =&gt; Small? Not necessary. Niche is a subset of population that can be served better than what companies out there can do for them.</li>
<li>Large Markets =&gt; A lot of people =&gt; More established competitors and companies you should understand first.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt>What about the viewpoint of creating a new market?</dt>
<dd><ul class="first last simple">
<li>New markets stem from old markets. Look at typewriter to computer. Human functions relating to human behavior will always exist.</li>
<li>We still need to understand what people have been doing now in order to improve and show them what can people do now with your product.</li>
</ul>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><em>Remember to always find context in your solutions.</em></p>
<p><strong>Mark’s recommendation =&gt; Go niche first, then growing market, then seek an established market</strong></p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Project Tips</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul>
<li><p class="first">Make your list of questions you want to ask to people</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If you&#8217;re starting off, go out and verify whether there is a pain point for people.</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">If verified already</p>
<p>Draw up a rough sketch of what you think the solution would look like and ask for people’s opinion.</p>
<p>Vet the questions and show the questions to your friends and family. They can help you hone the questions and focus the communication.</p>
</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt>Make a list of family and friends</dt>

</li>
<li><dl class="first docutils">
<dt><strong>How to approach strangers?</strong></dt>
<dd><ol class="first last arabic simple">
<li>First know that people are generally nice and they wouldn’t mind helping out a student. If people say no, they’re not rejecting you personally. They’re telling you that right now, they don&#8217;t want the opportunity to talk; it’s nothing personal.</li>
<li>Look for people who look bored.</li>
<li>Approach people and say “I’m a student and I’m working on my business plan, can you spare 30   seconds to talk with me about my business idea?”. This gives people a time-bound so they can evaluate whether they have the time and priority to talk with you.</li>
<li>Get people to say yes and then continue to get them to say yes again.</li>

<p><strong>Prototypes - Key Takeaway = Don’t get attached to them!</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Prototypes that you build at first should be fast, cheap, and disposable which means <em>pen/paper!</em></li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Draw a lot and throw them away until you’re happy with something</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Choosing users for feedback</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>For low fidelity prototypes, it’s okay to use your close circles (friends, family, colleages) for validation</li>
<li>For higher fidelity prototypes it’s best to test with wider circles (strangers, potential users)</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Gathering feedback</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Think about questions you want to ask your users before you go find them. Base these questions around:</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">What do people need ?</p>
</li>
<li><p class="first">What do people want?</p>

<p><strong>Implementing Feedback</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Try to design to be accessible to everyone, not just the most vocal user</li>
<li>Annotate your prototype with changes to make with sticky notes or invision notes.</li>
<li>Bounce ideas off of someone, a Udacity coach would be a great resource <a class="reference external" href="https://calendly.com/tend-coach/">here</a></li>
<li>Be flexible, you may need to change your approach entirely, but this is part of the process</li>

<p><strong>Understanding Customers with Geoffrey Moore</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">The first phase of marketing should always be to understand your customer. You can do this through:</p>
<p>Market Segmentation - FOCUS on the consumer, not product and make sure the product fits the customer. Break down your target market by certain characteristics like:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Behavior</li>
<li>Lifestyle</li>
<li>Preferences</li>
<li>Location</li>
<li>Demographics (income, race, age range, family status, etc.)</li>
<li>Occasion</li>
<li>Culture</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Best to start with a small, but high quality segment. Get feedback and iterate quickly</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Define a Persona</strong> Specific sample to represent your market segment</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Name - picture</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Demographic</li>
<li>Geographic</li>
<li>Occasional/Cultural</li>
<li>Behavioral/Psychographic (lifestyle)</li>
<li>Needs/Wants</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Next stage: Identifying Competitors</strong></p>
<p>Do your research! Do some google searches, ask your friends, ask random people on the subway</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><em>Competitive analysis</em> Identify 3 Competitors on two axes. Be specific!</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Possible Axes are price, level of personalization, time, etc</li>
<li>Think about what distinguishes your product among competitors</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Value Positioning Statement</strong></p>

<p><strong>Lesson Overview</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Desiree Motamedi - Product Marketing Manager, Google</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><strong>Main Message</strong>: Start off small and your business can snowball and grow into a great business. The key is to know your audience and figure out what they want. Think of how to make money from the start and not the end of your app design.</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Different schools of thought on making money exist though</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Back then:</strong> During the tech bubble in the late 1990&#8217;s: Entrepreneurs just focused on getting users. After they gain enough market share, they can figure out the revenue model.</p>
<p><strong>Now:</strong> Tech investments slowing down now (mid-2016). Investors want to see revenue earlier. Tech entrepreneurs need to figure out how to make profit revenue earlier.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Profits vs Revenue</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Revenue = total money you&#8217;re getting</li>
<li>Profit = total money you&#8217;re getting after deducting your costs.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<dl class="docutils">
<dt><strong>Metrics</strong></dt>
<dd><p class="first">These are important to understand because business involves keeping track of costs and keeping track of revenues. You want to make sure that you&#8217;re getting a return on your time, effort, and money.</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li><strong>Customer Loyalty</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div>This basically means whether customers are able to form a habit using your product. You can measure habit formation by measuring the frequency of usage of your app.</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li><strong>Customer Retention</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div>You need to make sure that customers stay with you for a long time. You can measure this by measuring the total time your customers use your application.</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="3">
<li><strong>Customer Acquisition Cost</strong></li>
</ol>
<blockquote class="last">
<div><dl class="docutils">
<dt>This is a very important metric because it outlines how much money you invest to gain a customer. Common acquisition costs involve advertisements, coupons, and sales to get people to sign up and use your app.</dt>
<dd>You need to make sure that the cost to get a customer is less than the total money you expect a customer to give you over the lifetime, in order words, Customer Acquisition Cost should be less than Customer Lifetime Value: <strong>CAC &lt; CLV</strong></dd>
</dl>
</div></blockquote>
</dd>
</dl>
<p><strong>KPIs</strong></p>
<p>A KPI is a measurement of progress or a milestone that we can constantly check to ensure that we are going in the right direction to achieve our goal.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Let&#8217;s break down the goal &#8220;Gain 10% new paying customers every month&#8221; to clearly define what is a metric, what is the KPI, and what is the goal that the KPI should refer to. Let&#8217;s work backwards and think of our goal first:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><p><strong>Goal:</strong> Gain 1000 paying customers by June, 2016</p>
<p><strong>Metric:</strong> Percent of Paying Customers for any given month</p>
<p><strong>KPI:</strong> Grow new Paying Customers by 10% every month</p>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Monetization Models</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Freemium</li>
<li>In-app billing</li>
<li>In-app payments</li>
<li>Advertisements</li>
<li>Premium</li>
</ol>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Key Point: Think about your business and think about your customer. How do you match your customer with your product.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Kevin Hale - Partner of Y-Combinator</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>The big question: Growth vs Monetization?
Kevin&#8217;s answer: Depends on what you’re trying to do.</p>
<blockquote>
<div>For example, social networks need a strong base of users before you can develop an advertising platform or sell user behavior information.</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Important:</strong> Have an idea of how to make money from the start and not at the end. We need to think about long term value for people so they can keep using our product over and over again.</p>
<p><strong>Ido Green</strong></p>
<p>Talks about the main process in product design and monetization</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Develop product</li>
<li>Acquisition (get users)</li>
<li>Retention (delight users and keep them)</li>
<li>Earning - Make it easy to pay<ol class="arabic">
<li>Fast form field fill out for eCommerce</li>
<li>Make In-app purchases super easy</li>
<li>Use Ads to enhance experience</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Project Tips</strong></p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Identify similar monetization models</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div>Do your research well. Go out into the App Store or Play Store and look at the top 20 grossing applications. Download them and use them and see how they make money.</div></blockquote>
<ol class="arabic simple" start="2">
<li>KPI’s</li>
</ol>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It’s a way to help you figure out whether you’re on the right track. In the later project, you’ll dive deeper into KPIs.</p>
<p>It’s fine to think about what would look good for you if you check in on your product performance every week, what do you want to see?</p>

<p>There is no lesson here so this podcast is completely optional to listen to if you don’t want to hear me talk.</p>
<p>We’re going to give a big picture overview of what you’ve learned so far in the Nanodegree program and tell you how to think about your next steps as you dive deeper into the learning more technical information in the Nanodegree program.</p>
<p>By now, you should be 1.5 to 2 months in your Nanodegree program.</p>
<p>Here are the big things you’ve learned so far:</p>
<p><strong>Validate your Idea</strong></p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Verifying the market</em>
- Best way to get feedback from your idea is to talk with real people
- Talk with friends of friends
- Don’t take feedback personally!</li>
</ul>
<p>You can also look at your competition. If there are competitors doing the same thing you want to do then there is a demand in the market and your competitors have done the hard work to verify the market demand already.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><em>Verifying your initial solution</em>
- You have an idea, but you now need to see if your implementation can work.
- Use prototype method to quickly validate your solutions
- Get feedback and update your prototypes. Go out and test the prototype again
- Test until you have a good user flow and user interface</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Build that Prototype</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Paper drawings are your best friend. They allow for fast and efficient iteration</p>
<p><em>Exceptions:</em> Virtual Reality, new types of technology such as 3D printing, etc.</p>
<p>You should still sketch out what you believe the interface can look like.
Want to figure out the UX, the entire experience and not just the visual cues
You can also make a pre-recorded video of how the new technology would work</p>
<p>Ask people to do tasks with your prototype. Don’t ask them what they think.</p>
<p>It’s very important you be there and see their frustrations, questions, and body language as they go through your User Experience.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Finding Target Audience</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>It&#8217;s important to build that persona. After talking with people for your prototype, you should have also asked them who they are and what they do for a living. Get to know these people in order   to build that persona.</p>
<p>You need to figure out how to market to these people</p>
<p>The value positioning statement is key to help you communicate your value and how different you are compared to anything else out there.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Making Money</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Need to understand your customer. The persona is useful to help you understand what monetization method can work for your customer. You need to build a money making mechanism that is compatible with your target audience. You need to know who these people are and how much disposable income they have.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Low disposable income -&gt; Ads</li>
<li>High disposable income -&gt; Subscription, premium, buy the software up front</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Design your money making mechanism into your app designs early on. Don’t just tack it on at a later time. This will ruin the carefully crafted experience you want to give to customers you’ve worked so hard on already. The monetization experience should be a core experience in your design.</p>
</div></blockquote>
<p><strong>Business = about driving long term value for your customer.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Final advice:</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<div><p>Take all your steps one step at a time. Congratulations! You’ve learned the major steps it takes to build and market your product.</p>
<p>Take the time now and reflect on what you need to do now for the next few months.
So where are we?</p>
<p>Congratulations if you’ve made it through this far in the course you have a solid understanding of the entire process it takes to develop your idea into a validated product.</p>
<p>What’s next? You’ll be diving deep into each aspect of entrepreneurship and will develop your idea on a deeper level.</p>
<p>From here on out, you’ll be diving deep into product design, prototyping, marketing, and monetization.</p>
